# Database ORM Framework with Design Patterns

A robust Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework implemented in Kotlin, showcasing the practical application of design patterns in database management systems.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a flexible and type-safe ORM system using modern software design patterns. Built with Kotlin, it provides a seamless interface for database operations while maintaining clean architecture principles.

## Architecture

The architecture of our ORM framework is represented in the class diagram below. It shows the core components and their relationships, including database connection management, query building system, table operations and various design patterns implementation. The diagram illustrates how different modules interact with each other to provide a cohesive database management solution.
